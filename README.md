## What is this?

Karel The Robot is a simple teaching environment for imperative programming basics.
The original idea was developed in the 1970s by Richard Pattis at Stanford University.

## How do I learn this?

I am in the process of recording [a lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCnnR6-JApE&list=PLbPrugU2oQ8UNMK_Gy0U8n2_B0vmL7OIN&index=1) on Karel The Robot.

## Where do I download the system?

Click [this download link](https://github.com/fredoverflow/karel-release/blob/master/karel.jar?raw=true). If for some reason this doesn't work, click `karel.jar` in the list above, then `Raw` or `View Raw`.

## How do I start the system?

Karel The Robot requires Java 7 or newer to run. Make sure you have Java installed!

On most operating systems, you can simply run a jar by double-clicking on it.

If double-clicking does not start the system, open a terminal inside the download folder and write:

    java -jar karel.jar

## How do I save my code?

The code is automatically saved to a new file each time you click the start button. The save folder is named `karel`, and it is located in your home directory. The full path is displayed in the title bar.
